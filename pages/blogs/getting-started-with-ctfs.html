      <p>Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are one of the most exciting and educational ways to learn cybersecurity. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to sharpen your skills, CTFs provide hands-on experience with real-world security challenges.</p>

      <h2>What is a CTF?</h2>
      <p>A Capture The Flag competition is a cybersecurity contest where participants solve security-related challenges to find hidden "flags" - usually strings of text that prove you've successfully completed the challenge.</p>

      <h2>Types of CTF Challenges</h2>

      <h3>üîê Cryptography</h3>
      <p>Challenges involving encryption, decryption, and cryptographic analysis. You might need to break ciphers, analyze cryptographic implementations, or exploit weak encryption schemes.</p>

      <h3>üåê Web Exploitation</h3>
      <p>Find and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. Common challenges include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication bypasses.</p>

      <h3>üîç Forensics</h3>
      <p>Analyze digital evidence to uncover hidden information. This might involve examining network traffic, memory dumps, or file systems.</p>

      <h3>üîÑ Reverse Engineering</h3>
      <p>Analyze compiled programs to understand their functionality and find vulnerabilities or hidden flags.</p>

      <h3>üíª Binary Exploitation</h3>
      <p>Exploit vulnerabilities in compiled programs, often involving buffer overflows, format string bugs, or return-oriented programming.</p>

      <h3>üïµÔ∏è OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)</h3>
      <p>Gather information using publicly available sources. These challenges test your research and investigation skills.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started: Your First CTF</h2>

      <h3>1. Choose Beginner-Friendly Platforms</h3>
      <p>Start with these excellent beginner platforms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PicoCTF</strong> - Designed for beginners with excellent tutorials</li>
        <li><strong>OverTheWire</strong> - Progressive challenges that build on each other</li>
        <li><strong>TryHackMe</strong> - Guided learning paths with detailed explanations</li>
        <li><strong>HackTheBox Academy</strong> - Structured learning modules</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Essential Tools</h3>
      <p>While you can start with just a web browser, these tools will be invaluable:</p>
      <pre><code># Basic tools for most CTFs
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text)
- Web browser with developer tools
- Command line terminal
- Python (for scripting)
- Burp Suite Community (for web challenges)
- Wireshark (for network analysis)
- Hex editor (HxD, hexedit)</code></pre>

      <h3>3. Learning Strategy</h3>
      <p>Here's how to approach your CTF learning journey:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start Small</strong> - Begin with the easiest challenges in each category</li>
        <li><strong>Read Writeups</strong> - After attempting a challenge, read how others solved it</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Regularly</strong> - Consistency is key to building skills</li>
        <li><strong>Join Communities</strong> - Connect with other CTF players for support and learning</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>NetKnights CTF Activities</h2>
      <p>At NetKnights, we regularly participate in CTF competitions and host internal practice sessions. Our CyberWatch Division organizes weekly CTF practice sessions where members can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work on challenges together</li>
        <li>Learn from more experienced members</li>
        <li>Prepare for major competitions</li>
        <li>Share knowledge and techniques</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>Ready to dive in? Here's what we recommend:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create accounts on PicoCTF and TryHackMe</li>
        <li>Complete your first 5 challenges in any category</li>
        <li>Join our Discord to connect with other members</li>
        <li>Attend our next CyberWatch Division meeting</li>
      </ol>
