# 🌐 NetKnights Club Website

Welcome to the **NetKnights Club Website** repository! This is the source code for our static club website, lovingly crafted by chaotic-good hackers and cybersecurity enthusiasts. Hosted on GitHub Pages, this website is our digital home for sharing updates, resources, and chaotic energy with the world.

> "Protect the net. Educate the future. Knight the nerds."

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **We're Not *That* NetKnights**  
> This website and club are in no way affiliated with [NetKnights GmbH](https://netknights.it/en/), the German IT security company.  
> We’re just a community-driven, youth-led cybersecurity club hosted at a public library.  
> If you're looking for professional IT services or solutions, you’re in the wrong castle.  
> But if you want to learn, tinker, and explore cybersecurity while occasionally yelling at broken scripts — welcome aboard!

## ⚔️ About the Website

The NetKnights Club website serves as:
- **A hub for our club activities**  
  Learn about our events, projects, and community initiatives.
- **A resource library**  
  Find guides, cheat sheets, and learning modules (Coming Soon™).
- **A showcase of our chaotic creativity**  
  Expect lots of fancy CSS, broken scripts, and “it works on my machine” moments.

Built with:
- 🌐 **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
  Simple, static, and stylish.
- 🎨 **SCSS**  
  For that extra flair (and frustration).

  > [!NOTE]
> This website is slowly being merged to DrKel's homelab server, if anything seems broken or off, please be patient.
