# 🛡️ NetKnights Cybersecurity Club Website

Welcome to the **NetKnights Cybersecurity Club Website** repository! This is the source code for our professional club website, designed to showcase our community-driven approach to cybersecurity education. Hosted on GitHub Pages, this website serves as our digital headquarters for sharing knowledge, resources, and opportunities with current and prospective members.

> "Protect the net. Educate the future. Knight the nerds."

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **We're Not *That* NetKnights**  
> This website and club are in no way affiliated with [NetKnights GmbH](https://netknights.it/en/), the German IT security company.  
> We’re just a community-driven, youth-led cybersecurity club hosted at a public library.  
> If you're looking for professional IT services or solutions, you’re in the wrong castle.  
> But if you want to learn, tinker, and explore cybersecurity while occasionally yelling at broken scripts — welcome aboard!
